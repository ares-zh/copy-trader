# Copy Trader landing page

A single-page marketing site for the Copy Trader Web3 product. The experience highlights the core promise — "Learn your trade, become you" — and demonstrates how the platform syncs with Hyperliquid, trains an AI agent, and deploys 24/7 automated trading on behalf of the user.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Landing page markup with hero, feature breakdown, workflow, AI lab, and modal dialogs.
- `styles.css` – Futuristic dark-theme styling tuned for traders.
- `script.js` – Lightweight interactivity: modal management, mock Hyperliquid sync copy, and simulated trade preview.

## Running locally

No build step is required. Serve the files with any static server, e.g.:

```bash
python -m http.server 5173
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in a browser.
